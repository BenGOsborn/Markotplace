# https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps (write:repo_hook) - when a user connects their repo, set a webhook in their account which will auto fire to my server on request
# When a webhook is fired for a change to the deploy branch, we should download that repo, check the dockerfile for any problems, build the image, and then delete it
# This should also be called on a successful app creation (ill have to integrate with my own server for that) AND we should have a manual deploy option for the app (user authenticated of course)
# This will need access to the users dev account details, how will I integrate that ?
# Set the deployment status as the current deployed branch on Markotplace

# **** Maybe I need to store the webhook secret somewhere too ???
# **** Im pretty sure that if a user gives full repo permissions I can write webhooks without asking for permission ? (YES IT DOES!)
